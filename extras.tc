## Notes:
#
# - The default TERMPATH for finding termcap entries is:
#     ./termcap:$HOME/.local/share/misc/termcap:/usr/share/misc/termcap
#
# - Before searching TERMPATH, emuterm first consults TERMCAP and TERM.
#   TERMCAP can contain a filename starting with '/', or a complete
#   termcap entry. If the latter, TERM must match the name in the termcap
#   entry and the emuterm -t option.
#
# - Use "eval `tsete <termtype>`" to set TERM and TERMCAP to meet the
#   requirements above. This emulates the functionality of the old BSD
#   "eval `tset -Q -s <termtype>`".
#
# - If emuterm complains about an unsupported termcap capability, try
#   removing that capability (or a conflicting capability) from your
#   copy of the termcap file.
#
# - Modern Linux distros use terminfo, not termcap, and the default install
#   includes terminfo entries for only a handful of terminal types.
#   To install terminfo entries for many old terminals, try:
#     sudo apt-get install ncurses-term
#
# - To convert and add a termcap entry to the terminfo database, try:
#     tic -sr -e <term-name> <termcap-file>
#   Conversely, to extract a termcap entry from the terminfo database, try:
#     infocmp -CKr <term-name>
#
# - The supplied termtypes.tc is from GNU termcap 1.3.1 since it has a GPL2
#   license. Unfortunately, some of the entries use terminfo formatting
#   strings (unsupported, even by GNU termcap 1.3.1) or have commented out
#   the capability (e.g., the c108 'cm' capability). To obtain a more
#   compatible termcap file, try downloading:
#     https://www.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.4BSD/etc/termcap
#   Note that that file does not include the "extras.tc" entries below.

## Additional termcap entries:
# Digi-Log 33 was a portable terminal, displaying on an external monitor or TV.
